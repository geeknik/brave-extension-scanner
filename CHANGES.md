# Changes Made to Fix Issues

## 1. Module Import Issues

The main issue was related to ES module imports in the browser extension context. Browser extensions require relative paths for imports, and we were using bare module specifiers like `import * as acorn from 'acorn'`.

### Solutions:
- Created a simplified version of acorn.js and acorn-walk.js in the src/lib directory
- Updated import statements to use relative paths (e.g., `import * as acorn from '../lib/acorn.js'`)
- Implemented simplified versions of the libraries to avoid external dependencies

## 2. JSZip Integration

The extension was using JSZip to extract CRX files, but this was causing issues with bundling.

### Solutions:
- Created a `simulateZipExtraction` function that provides a mock implementation
- Updated the code to use this function instead of directly using JSZip
- This approach allows for easier testing and development without external dependencies

## 3. AST-based Analysis

We improved the static analyzer to use AST-based analysis instead of just regex patterns.

### Solutions:
- Implemented a more sophisticated static analyzer that uses AST traversal
- Added pattern matching for various security-relevant code constructs
- Maintained the regex-based analysis as a fallback for when AST parsing fails

## 4. Webpack Configuration

Updated the webpack configuration to handle the dependencies properly.

### Solutions:
- Added fallbacks for Node.js built-in modules
- Increased performance limits to accommodate larger bundle sizes
- Added proper build scripts for development and production

## 5. Additional Improvements

- Enhanced the common.js utility with more helper functions
- Added better documentation in the README.md
- Improved error handling throughout the codebase
- Added more comprehensive threat detection capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Replace the simplified acorn and JSZip implementations with proper browser-compatible versions
2. Add unit tests for the new functionality
3. Implement more sophisticated analysis techniques
4. Add support for Manifest V3 extensions
5. Improve the UI for better user experience
